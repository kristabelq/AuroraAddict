## Alternative Revenue Models

### Option 1: Direct Hotel Partnerships

**Concept:** Negotiate directly with hotels, bypassing OTA affiliates

**How It Works:**
1. Identify top properties (Arctic Glass Igloo, Northern Lights Village, etc.)
2. Contact them directly with traffic/audience proof
3. Negotiate custom commission rate: 10-20%
4. They pay you directly for bookings
5. Use custom booking forms or phone bookings

**Commission Potential:**
- **10-20% of booking value** (vs 4-6% from OTAs)
- Example: €600 booking × 15% = €90 (vs €27 from Booking.com)

**Pros:**
✅ 2-3× higher commission
✅ Direct relationship with properties
✅ Can negotiate exclusive packages
✅ Control customer experience
✅ Faster payments
✅ Build long-term partnerships

**Cons:**
❌ Requires manual outreach/contracts
❌ No unified booking platform
❌ Lower trust (customers prefer big brands)
❌ Manual payment tracking
❌ Time-intensive
❌ Limited inventory

**Best For:**
- 5-10 featured "hero" properties
- High-value relationships
- Long-term strategy (6+ months)

**Implementation Timeline:**
- Month 1-3: Build traffic, prove concept with OTA affiliates
- Month 4-6: Approach top properties with data
- Month 7+: Negotiate and sign direct deals

---

### Option 2: Own Booking Platform

**Concept:** Become the OTA, hotels pay you 15-25% commission

**Approach A: White-label Booking Engine**
- Use services like Beds24, Cloudbeds, or RoomRaccoon API
- Integrate booking functionality into your platform
- Hotels pay you 15-25% commission per booking
- You handle customer service, payments, etc.

**Approach B: Extend Hunt System**
- Leverage existing Hunt feature
- Accommodations create "Hunt" listings (stays, not tours)
- Users book via your Stripe integration
- You charge 10-15% platform fee

**Commission Potential:**
- **15-25% platform fee** (vs 4-6% affiliate)
- Example: €600 booking × 20% = €120 commission

**Pros:**
✅ Highest margins (15-25%)
✅ Full control of experience
✅ Own customer data
✅ Brand building
✅ Differentiation

**Cons:**
❌ High development cost
❌ Customer service burden

- After proving affiliate concept
- When you have leverage/audience

**Implementation Timeline:**
- Year 1: Focus on affiliates
- Year 2: Test MVP with 3-5 properties
- Year 3: Full platform rollout

---

### Option 3: Hybrid Model (Recommended Long-term)

**Concept:** Use all three approaches strategically

**Strategy:**
```
Tier 1 Properties (Top 5-10):
└─ Direct partnerships (15-20% commission)

Tier 2 Properties (Next 20-30):
└─ OTA Affiliates (Booking.com, Agoda: 4-7%)

Tier 3 Properties (Rest):
└─ OTA Affiliates only

All Properties:
└─ Future: Offer own booking (optional)
```

**Benefits:**
- Maximize revenue per property tier
- Reduce risk (diversification)
- Build towards full platform

### Click Tracking Implementation

**Frontend (Business Profile Page):**
```typescript
async function handleBookingClick(roomTypeId: string, platform: string) {
  // Track click via API
  const res = await fetch('/api/affiliate/track', {
    method: 'POST',
    body: JSON.stringify({
      businessId,
      roomTypeId,
      platform
    })
  });

  const { url } = await res.json();

  // Open affiliate link in new tab
  window.open(url, '_blank', 'noopener,noreferrer');
}
```

**Backend (API Route):**
```typescript
// POST /api/affiliate/track
export async function POST(req: Request) {
  const { businessId, roomTypeId, platform } = await req.json();

  // Get room type
  const room = await prisma.roomType.findUnique({
    where: { id: roomTypeId }
  });

  // Get affiliate link
  const affiliateUrl = room.affiliateLinks[platform];

  // Track click
  await prisma.affiliateClick.create({
    data: {
      businessId,
      roomTypeId,
      platform,
      destinationUrl: affiliateUrl,
      userId: session?.user?.id
    }
  });

  // Increment click count
  await prisma.roomType.update({
    where: { id: roomTypeId },
    data: { clickCount: { increment: 1 } }
  });

  return NextResponse.json({ url: affiliateUrl });
}
```

```

---

### Cookie Consent

**Required for Tracking:**
- Affiliate clicks use cookies

if (hasUserConsentedToCookies()) {
  trackAffiliateClick();
}
```
